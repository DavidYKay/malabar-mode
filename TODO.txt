Short term

- Code completion

- Classpath completion?

- Import precedence ordering, in conjunction with defaulting import to
  first matching class
  - e.g. prefer java.util.List to java.awt.List

- Organize imports
  
- goto-type-at-point (with disassembly if needed)
  - create if necessary

- Implement interface

- Extend abstract class

- Code generation
  - getters/setters
  - delegation

- Run test directly (i.e. not with Maven)

Long term
