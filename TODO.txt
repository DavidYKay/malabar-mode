Short term

- Code completion

- Classpath completion?

- Organize imports
  
- goto-type-at-point (with disassembly if needed)
  - create if necessary

- Code generation
  - getters/setters
  - delegation

- Support standalone running of TestNG tests

- Better JUnit results reporting

- Add fringe indicators of compile errors/warnings and failed tests

- Maybe fix "jump to failed test" to actually jump to the test?

- integrate some templating facility (that is, auto-insert on new file)

- Automatic import of necessary classes when overriding method

- Automatic qualification of classnames when
  extending/overriding/implementing and there is a name clash

Long term

- Refactoring

- xref

- hyperlinking stack traces?
