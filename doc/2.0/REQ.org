* Requirements for 2.0

  #+OPTIONS: toc:2   

** Separate maven from malabar-mode

Currently malabar-mode requires a certain version of maven to be install.

Separate the project management out of malabar-mode.  Instead, provide
a way to get the following based on the packaging system (maven, groovy, etc)

# classpath
# source dirs
# test source dirs

Use the test class path.


** Grok pom.xml using groovy grape
This ends up being much faster than spawning a new mvn process, also not dependant upon maven.

** Use a groovy REPL
Use Groovy as if it were a repl.   This adds a dependency on groovy-mode.



** flycheck integration using groovy
Rather than spawn the a separate compile, use the running groovy inferior process

** When opening a new java file, auto-populate with a template
The template needs to be configurable per project.
** Easily add classpath to groovysh
** Run an application (main)
** Run a unit test

* Future Requirements

** Use a separate classpath for test and runtime
