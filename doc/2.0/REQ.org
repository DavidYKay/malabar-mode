* Requirements for 2.0

#+OPTIONS: toc:2   

** Separate maven from malabar-mode

Currently malabar-mode requires a certain version of maven to be install.

Separate the project management out of malabar-mode.  Instead, provide
a way to get the following based on the packaging system (maven, groovy, etc)

# classpath
# source dirs
# test source dirs

Also, projects need to have 2 classpaths: one for runtime and one for test.


** Grok pom.xml using groovy grape
This ends up being much faster than spawning a new mvn process, also not dependant upon maven.

** Use a groovy REPL
Use Groovy as if it were a repl.   This adds a dependency on groovy-mode.
